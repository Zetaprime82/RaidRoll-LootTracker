3. Loot Tracker
Loot Window

While using this addon you will send information regarding any epic loot to the raid and guild in the hidden addon channel. Anyone else using the addon will pick up these messages in raid (you can also pick up messages in guild by enabling the option in the options menu (see 4. Options Menu) ) and display the loots in the loot tracker window. You can link all the items that dropped from the current boss by clicking "Link Loot". "Clear Data" will clear all data. M1 and M2 are buttons that only show up for raid leader and assists, they announce in raid chat the strings: "Roll [Item] Main Spec" and "Roll [Item] Off Spec" {[Item] gets replaced by the itemlink automatically}. These strings can be changed in the options menu. You can also enable a third M3 button in the options.
